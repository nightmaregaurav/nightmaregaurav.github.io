Anyone who is interested can offer their bid to the property and one can easily find out if it is the right price for the property or not. This system gives a platform for the same user to perform both actions: buying and selling. It helps users to find a suitable property to purchase using the search feature which provides a handful of tools to filter search contents. Using the power and potential of python programming language working with technologies like Maria DB, Redis, ASGI, Bootstrap, jQuery, etc."

Doctors will get a platform to write medical reports in an electric medium, allowing them to manage their appointments with patients so the risky and unsecured traditional paper file method will be replaced. Additionally, Third Eye will allow users to print their medical reports in hard and or soft copy it will be easy to extract and share only the required part. The records will be grouped categorically. Doctors will be allowed to comment or write reviews on old reports so that old reports may also be used to explain the new issues.
